## Usage

Firstly make sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Version 6 or higher and [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)  installed.
Next clone or download the repo. You can access the repo through your terminal by entering the following into your terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/hrsf73-Nimble-Newts/Thesis
```
then change directories
```
cd Thesis
```
install the necessary packages locally
```
npm install
```
and run webpack in watch mode
```
npm run react-dev
```
and run the application in your local environment
```
npm run server-dev
```
The local version of ParkBound defaults to port 3000. Open up your browser and type [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) into your browser. Now your app should be up and running. If you'd like to run tests, please shut down the server by pressing control + c (mac) in the tab you ran react-dev. Run the testing suite by opening a new terminal tab and typing:
```
npm run test
```
Be sure to end the terminal testing process with control+c after testing has finished and restart your server with one of the server commands above.
