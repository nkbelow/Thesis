9,Sidewinder,Olathe,Colorado,38.59656,-107.88875,21,This trail description is South-to-North. You will want a shuttle vehicle at the other trailhead off H75 Road. We used Peach Valley Road to drop the shuttle at that end.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Sidewinder Trail is a relentless\, rocky\, technical\, physical adventure on the bike. There are very few extended climbs or downhills\, but my GPS still measured 2500' of climbing and 3000' of total descending by the time we were done.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Mostly it is a constant mind-game of rocky\, technical bike-handling tests. There are very few sections of fast cruising. The trail is extremely well-built though so the technical challenges are mostly rideable for a skilled rider. There were 6 of us on our ride and while we were all bucked-off at various places\, usually a couple of us would clean most features. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />As the name implies\, the Sidewinder weaves in and out of many arroyos as you cling to the western edge of the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness Area. You will climb and descend these arroyos enjoying many slickrock drops and ledges along the way\, as well as about a thousand other rocky treats.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Sidewinder is not for beginners. I would imagine they would hate it and probably wind up hurt. For a rider loving a technical\, physical workout its one of the best trails I've ever ridden. It took our group 5 hours to ride the whole thing including all our breaks and lunch and all that. If you google &quot;Sidewinder Trail&quot; then you will find a map on the BLM website that shows the route and many other bailout options.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Go ride it... you will not be disappointed.,Take Hwy 50 to the town of Olathe. You could also ride this trail from Delta to Olathe\, but I highly recommend riding it South-to-North from near Olathe and towards Delta for a little more net downhill on the trail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Olathe\, turn east on Falcon road and drive about 4 miles. Make a left when you come to Peach Valley Rd. After about a mile you will see a parking area on your right with a road leading up into the sandy hills. Park here and ride the bike up the sandy hill climbing for a few hundred feet.

Granted you do not have to ride the entire trail to enjoy the picturesque riding which includes high plateaus\, drainages\, gullies\, washouts\, prairie\, and plenty of winding single track to connect it all. Throw some absolutely killer climbs and long decents in the mix and whalla!!! Thats the trail in a nutshell. Every aspect of riding in one epic journey. While the trail is not overly technical it is not heavily traveled and the views make up for the lack of extremely technical riding. Do not attempt to ride this trail if it wet. It takes about ten feet for the mud to build up so much that the tires dont roll and the bike becomes about 20 pounds heavier. I rode for five days in the middle of summer and only saw three other riders besides my riding buddies.

169,Lost Lake Tr,Seward,Alaska,60.1726,-149.41046,7,This trail does get easier the farther up it you go.

The thick alder have given way to classic tundra and a few scattered stands of spruce trees here &amp; there.

Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area\, including a vista northward\, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail\, while still involving travel over rocks\, roots\, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield.

Overall\, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride\, great views\, great history\, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid\, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also\, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails\, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also\, some of the carriage roads are private\, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked\, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails\, which offer information such as points of interest\, trail length\, difficulty\, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car\, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again\, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight\, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads\, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high\, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.,There are several points of entry into the network of trails\, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island\, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233\, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor\, ME.  To get to 233\, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N\, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth\, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or\, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.  In the off season\, lodging from bed and breakfasts\, to waterfront cabins\, to KOA campgrounds can be found anywhere.  ,1

392,Church Rocks,Washington,Utah,37.18445,-113.41533,8,You made it to the drainage pipe now muster up some courage and ride through it. You may have to walk a few feet once you leave the pipe. The trail climbs out of the wash on the left and when it crosses the wash again take the trail on the left up onto slickrock. Now follow the cairns and old painted dashes on the rock.

At about 1.7 miles you will run into a very sandy hill\, this sand section will last just about 100 yards and then is done\, in the middle of it is an intersection with the Spanish Wash trail\, any equestrian traffic that has been on the trail will more than likely exit here. Continuing on stay right on the main trail when you encounter a small singletrack that takes off to the left. The intersection with the Church Rocks trail will be an obvious T\, although ride-able either direction I recommend taking a right and doing the loop counter-clockwise. You will ride back towards the north for about a mile but higher up on the hillside so there are more slickrock sections mixed in. You will come to a large U turn and the trail goes up a short but steep rock section and then takes off south up the ledge.

Its advisable to go down the wash to get off of the ridge and start heading back north. Once at the bottom you will notice a couple other trails\, these are the other access trails mentioned in the directions. There will be a couple different routes up the slick rock\, just follow the tire tracks in the sand or make your own fun route\, they all end up towards the top at the same place. Just look for the main trail at the top of the hill marked by large carins and all the other tire tracks\, follow it north back to the Prospector trail.&lt;br /&gt;<br />,The Church Rocks trail is about a 3 mile\, mostly slickrock loop\, and although there are a couple other access routes due to parking issues etc.\, the Prospector trail is the most popular route to get to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From St. George head north on I-15 to exit 16\, the hwy 9 towards Hurricane exit.

The Thunder Mountain single track (#098) starts here winding through forest canyons climbing and descending the same 250 ft many times for the next 3 miles. The trail gradually climbs to roughly 8300 ft at 10.5 miles from the start (awesome views!) and then starts a rapid decent past red cliffs &amp; hoodooï¿½s\, switchbacking down the canyons. Some technical stuff as the switchbacks are rather tight &amp; steep and some of the trail is very narrow along ledges. At mile 14.2 and roughly 7300 ft you intersect with trail # 066\, go right and the trail quickly turns into a 20 mph downhill scream on a forested single track back to the Thunder Mountain TH almost 2 miles later.&lt;br /&gt;<br />This is an awesome ride! However if you are like me and from near sea level it will quickly remind you that you are at 7-8000 ft as the air is pretty thin and the climbs can be pretty tough.

Cross the the cattle guard and after a tenth of a mile\, look for a jeep road on the right. About 20 yards in there is a large rock placed to block vehicle access.&lt;br /&gt;<br />From here the trail is fairly well defined\, and there are signs as needed. Initially arrows on small\, white signs\, and later orange paint on trees\, then back to the signs. &lt;br /&gt;<br />There are a couple of navigational gotchas: &lt;br /&gt;<br />First\, at 5.8 miles\, immediately after crossing a creek bed on a short section of jeep road\, look to the right. The trail goes back to singletrack here and the sign for the turn is easy to miss.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Second\, you will come to a well defined jeep road (the same road you left after the creek bed) and it will be unclear which way to go. Go right for a short distance and look for the orange paint on several trees on the left side of the road. Continue the singletrack here. &lt;br /&gt;<br />Heading on\, the trail continues to be well defined\, and most of the intersections are marked with orange paint\, cairns\, or signs. There are a couple of singletrack intersections that are not marked\, but either go straight\, or take the one that is obviously more traveled. It's easy to get a little lost\, even using the printed directions from the local club's website\, so it is HIGHLY recommend to download the GPX file from here and load it into a smartphone or GPS device.&lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail itself is a solid intermediate ride with lots of rocks\, both loose and embedded. There are some small ledges and a handful of mild switchbacks. The few technical features are well marked\, giving riders enough time to either dismount and check them out\, or let out a WHOOP and drop in. 100% of this trail is ridable\, including the tech features once you scope out your line.&lt;br /&gt;<br />The terrain is rolling with short\, fairly steep descents immediately followed by quick\, punchy climbs. The scenery is amazing as you traverse deep forest\, hillside meadows\, and the tops of several cliffs. There are lots of sharp rocks\, so tubeless tires are ideal. With tubes\, run slightly higher pressure to help avoid pinch flats.&lt;br /&gt;<br />There is cell service only on the ridgetops\, and there is not much traffic\, so keep that in mind if riding it alone. Also\, there is poison ivy everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail is a 'lollypop' with a very short stem consisting of the doubletrack just off of Victoria Lake Road\, as well as the short section of road leading back to the parking area.,From Rapid City:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head south on US-16 W/Mt Rushmore Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Moon Meadows Dr. It is next to the Black Hills National Forest Research Facility and 4.3 miles from the Colonial House Restaurant back in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go 2.3 miles\, then turn right onto Dunsmore Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go .1 miles and turn left on to Sheridan Lake Rd. It's a 'T' intersection with a convenience store on the left.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go about 3 and a half miles and look for Victoria Lake Rd on the right. It's a triangle entrance\, and there is parking area the triangle.,55
397,J.E.M. Trail,Hurricane,Utah,37.20023,-113.21773,13,This trail is a combination of a network of trails. I rode it counter clockwise. I starts out with the Gould Rim\, then on to the JEM trail\, and finally to Hurricane Rim. This is a great intermediate ride. Very fast\, rolling hills. Not a lot of climbing. If you dont want to do the whole 21 miles\, consider just doing the JEM trail out and back. <br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Description from justin70:&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This trail is a combination of trails. It is usually ridden counter-clockwise\, so that the JEM trail is ridden down-hill. There are a number of trail heads that can be used.<br /><br />By doing the whole network (Hurricane Rim\, Gould's Rim\, JEM Trail)\, you get a 22 mile epic cross country loop.<br /><br />I recommend parking at the Virgin trailhead for JEM - that way\, you get to finish the ride with JEM\, which has the best flow\, is the funnest of the three\, and is primarily downhill. <br /><br />Turn right off of State Road 9 onto Sheep Bridge Road just before you enter Virgin\, Utah. Cross the Virgin River and take the first right after the cattle guard. Follow the two track to the end (this is the trailhead).<br /><br />Start riding going west on the Hurricane Rim\, which has the most technical bits and the biggest climb. Transition to the Gould's Rim\, which has some tech\, some doubletrack\, and some flowy BMX-style ups and downs. Then finish with the JEM\, which is a mostly big-ring affair\, except for the one very technical drop from the top into the wash.<br /><br />This trail as a loop demands respect. It includes rocks\, distance\, desert weather\, vertical exposure and remoteness. Take adequate food\, water and spares and ride with care.,From the town of Hurricane\, head west on highway 59 towards Lake Powell. After only about 1/2 mile up a steep hill\, park in the parking lot at the top next to the Radio towers. This is the trail head. ,59

441,Elephant Head,Tucson,Arizona,31.76514,-110.96732,13,The Elephant Head Mountain Bike Route is a combination of little-traveled roads and remote trails designed especially for these versatile\, muscle-powered vehicles. Winding across the scenic foothills of the Santa Rita Mountains in the shadow of the dramatic landmark for which it was named\, the route was designed both to challenge a rider's skill and to provide a scenic\, backcountry experience.<br /><br />One end of the ride is at the mouth of Madera Canyon Recreation Area. The other is at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitor Center on the road to the top of Mount Hopkins.<br /><br />From the Madera Canyon trailhead\, the ride follows old jeep tracks across the desert grasslands and mesquite flats to the base of Elephant Head Rock\, where it turns into a single-track trail. As the trail curls around the Rock\, it heads up Chino Canyon into Chino Basin along a steep old mining road.<br /><br />At the top of the climb to Chino Basin\, the ride turns south along a rugged mountain trail over a saddle then down a nice grade into Agua Caliente Canyon. After crossing Agua Caliente Creek\, the route leads along a couple of little-used forest roads around a couple of foothills that mark the western limits of the Santa Rita Range. The ride ends at the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center where water and restrooms are available. Or you can just make a quick turn around in the parking lot and do it all over again in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Equestrians and hikers also use this trail\, and vehicles use the 4-wheel drive roads\, so be alert for hazards.<br /><br />Before visiting this trail\, call the Nogales Ranger District for current trail conditions which can vary with season\, weather and maintenance status.

457,Indian (1300),Cuchara,Colorado,37.46008,-105.13122,14,This is an ATV track that winds its way thru the mountains and forest on the leeward side of the Sangreís for 14 miles from Forest Service road 421 on the north end down to the Bear Lake campground at the end of Forest Service Road 413 to the south.  This is a scenic area with the Spanish Peaks across the valley to the east and the high Sangre de Cristos to the southwest.  When I arrived at the north trailhead I was disappointed to see that it was an ATV track up into the trees.  I tend to be a singletrack snob\, and I usually donít like to ride trails popular with the throttle twisting types ñ churned up dirt and rocks isnít my idea of a fun way to spend the day ñ but this trail turned out to be firm track the whole way.  If you choose to ride the north portion of the trail you better bring your climbing legs ñ it goes from 8\,500 to 10\,500 feet in about six miles.  The trail is in good shape\, so it is mostly just a matter of sitting in the saddle and cranking\, but it is a long climb\, especially if you arenít used to the altitude.  From that first summit you descend on fairly fast doubletrack 500 vertical feet into Bonnett Park and then do a slow and easy ascent for the next eight miles up over the next ridge to the campground\, at about 10\,500í.<br /><br />There are a few alternate routes to consider.  If you want to skip the 2\,000í climb out of the north trailhead you may want to start at the Spring Creek trailhead on the south side of the town of Cuchara.  From there it is about four miles uphill on the Dodge Ton Trail (1302) to where it joins the Indian Trail a bit south of Bonnet Park.  Or\, similarly\, the Baker Creek Trail (1301) further south of Cuchara connects into the Indian Trail a few miles further south.  I have never done it\, but if you really want to make an epic day out of it you can almost double the miles by continuing south from the Bear Lake campground to the Trenchara Peak road (436)\, go up that road and pick up the North Fork Trail (1309) and ride it to the Purgatoire Campground on North Fork Road (34).  While you are at it\, what the heck\, take the lung-busting road all the way to the saddle on the north side of Trenchera Peak (13\,517í).,Take highway 12 south thru La Veta; on the south side of town you will find Forest Road 421 heading west into the mountains.  Take that road about eight miles or so till you find the obvious trailhead and parking area.,26

Ride along the Turtle Wall to the overlook\, then head south\, now on the Paradise Rim trail.  The trail will make a sharp left and provide some sustaines technical descent that will make you appreciate your suspension.  As you continue East\, look for singletrack opportunites to the left (North).  If you go down\, to the right\, you'll end up in town and have to climb the pavement back to the parking lot.  If you keep curving left\, you'll rejoin the Turtle Wall and get to ride the fun part again on the way back.,From St George\, head north on Bluff Street.

454,Cisneros / Snowslide,San Isabel,Colorado,37.98067,-105.07916,16,(NB: my odometer was acting funny on this trip\, so take my distance measurements as estimates.) You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise; I recommend going counterclockwise to take advantage of the Snowslide Trail downhill.  Starting from the bottom of the Snowslide trail\, ride up thru the recreation area to the trailhead for the Cisneros trail\, or just ride thru the group campground at the end of the road\, which also will get you onto the Cisneros.  Begin climbing.  Iím not big on grunting uphill\, and Iím even less thrilled about pushing my bike up a trail.  While it is possible to ride up the Cisneros if you are a man of steel\, most people will probably end up pushing.  And pushing.  And pushingÖ  By the time I got to the top of the trail I think I pushed a good three miles or more.  Yuck. There is a steep section in the middle that goes on for a couple miles with lots of altitude gain.  Then\, after cresting the ridge there is a very pleasant mile and a half or so of gentle uphill thru a meadow area.  Then you encounter a steeper and more heavily bouldered trail that will often force you off the saddle.  After picking up nearly three thousand vertical feet in about nine miles or so you will come to the Greenhorn Mountain Rd (FR369).  Take a left (south) and go about a mile and a half till you see the sign for the Snowslide Trail.  Go to the left (east) uphill till you finally crest out at the top.  You probably have pedaled close to eleven miles to get to that point.  The views are great.  To the north you have a clear view of Pikeís Peak.  To the northeast you will see the city of Pueblo.  Now comes the payoff.  The downhill portion of Snowslide Trail is rocky\, steep\, narrow\, twisting\, root infested\, and challenging.  In other words\, a *lot* of fun.  It took nearly eleven miles of uphill to get to the top ñ you will get to the bottom in about four miles.  Get it?  Steep.  Not far from the top is a nasty\, technical section. The hardcore riders will be grinning; everybody else will be dreading what is to come.  Donít worry\, it only lasts a hundred yards or so.  After that the trail is mostly rideable by anyone with good technical skills.  What a blast!  Note that near the bottom the trail forks.  Go left if you parked in the recreation area; go right if you parked on the highway. Picking a rating for this trail was difficult to me.  As I was pushing my way up the Cisneros\, the number kept decreasing\, but by the time I got to the bottom of the Snowslide Trail my rating jumped back up.  If you donít mind long uphills then you probably will feel it is worth a try.  Oh\, if you donít want to push your way up the Cisneros\, and you have a ground crew\, you could just have them drive you to the top of Snowslide.,This trail description combines two trails in a loop: the Cisneros and Snowslide trails that start at the Lake Isabel Recreation Area in the Wet Mountains\, southwest of Pueblo.  There are lots of places to start.  I recommend parking at the Snowslide trail\, which has two endpoints; one just inside the south entrance to the recreation area\, and another a bit down highway 165\, past the entrance to the recreation area.,26

573,Mammoth Rock Trail,Mammoth Lakes,California,37.61858,-118.99337,2,Just start out going down the trailhead (you will notice the &quot;no bicycles&quot; part of the sign has been <br />painted over\, bikes ARE now allowed on this trail).  Be wary of hikers and their dogs\, especially <br />on weekends.  This is a fun\, pretty easy downhill that goes right by Mammoth Rock.  Be careful <br />while looking out at the view\, however\, or you may find yourself going off the edge of the trail\, <br />which can be pretty narrow at parts.  The bottom of the trail gets a bit sandy.  At the end of the <br />trail\, you can choose to go left or continue straight.  Go left for a shortcut back to Old Mammoth <br />Road (it will drop you off in an empty dirt parking lot\, just get on the road and go left--you will hit <br />Old Mammoth Road in about a minute).  If you go straight\, you will come out nearer the <br />Motocross track\, from there go left on the road and you will shortly get back to Old Mammoth <br />Road.  <br /><br />Then\, go to Salsas Taqueria on the corner of Old Mammoth Road and Cheateau Road for a <br />reasonably priced Mexican lunch!,From Main Street in the town of Mammoth Lakes\, take Old Mammoth Road all the way up to the &lt;br /&gt;trail head.

The trailhead is not too far past a (very) little Forest Service building of &lt;br /&gt;some kind.  It is on the left hand side of the road\, and there will probably be a car or two parked &lt;br /&gt;there.  If you drive instead of riding up to the trail\, you will need someone to drive you back up\, &lt;br /&gt;if you don't want to ride back to the car.  To make things easier\, I would say just ride up to the &lt;br /&gt;trailhead\, unless you hate climbs.,58

654,Kennedy Peak,Edinburg,Virginia,38.72806,-78.51506,10,This is a very rocky\, continually challenging trail.  Stephen's trail alternates between flowy singletrack and rock garden mania.  It sidehills a few miles\, then you start to veer east and make the climb to the ridgetop.  The climb is nothing less than brutal in places.  The combination of grade and technical requirements will force most off their bikes a time or two\, but it's a great ride.  When you hit the ridgetop\, go right on the Massanutten trail.  Again\, more cool singletrack and and rock gardens with an occasional view of the valley between Massanutten and Shenandoah.

First\, it's all singletrack; you don't need miles of fire road to make a legitimate loop.  Second\, while there are some real technical challenges\, even for advanced riders\, you won't spend nearly as much time on mandatory hike-a-bikes.  It also gets a lot less traffic; well worth the extra trouble to find it.,On I-81\, take the Edinburg exit and head East.  When the road Ts in Town\, go left.  In less than a mile\, look for the sign indicating state route 675 to the right.  Turn here and follow the signs--you will have to make a number of turns and take a few forks\, but you're staying in 675 the whole way.  After 9 or 10 miles\, you'll see Camp Roosevelt on the left.

664,Elizabeth Furnace,Front Royal,Virginia,38.93506,-78.32004,15,This was a tough ride over advanced terrain due to elevation changes\, and frequency and types of obstacles.  Terrain is a mix of doubletrack fire roads and singletrack with several\, extended rock gardens\, rock outcroppings\, technical climbs and descents\, and the distance will probably vary considerably depending on how you build your loop.  It is in the Appalachian foothills (Shenandoah Range)\, so expect some serious climbing (well\, at least for us East Coasters).  The saving grace is that a good portion of this was on the initial fireroad section\, so establishing something of a cadence was not impossible (loose gravel and sand in the climbs is not conducive to great speed\, necessarily).  I would suggest getting a trail map; the blue trail is extremely advanced\, very rocky\, and would most likely require even the more advanced intermediate riders to dismount and walk portions (admittedly\, it was tough just hiking it with the rocks\, and in bike cleats).  There are 4-5 creek crossings that were encountered\, 3 of which were significant due to depth and large\, slick rock.  It was a fantastic ride\, and took us about 4.5-5 hours to complete.   Bring plenty of fluids\, food (nothing around for miles)\, first aid kit\, and full suspension (you could do this on a hardtail\, but rear travel made this a lot more enjoyable I think).   I will definitely do this ride again\, and possibly take part in the Shenandoah Mtn 100 race next year (I'd do it this year\, but considering the shape I'm in\, it would probably kill me).,Trails Located in George Washington National Forest\, approx 30 minutes north of Lurray Caverns off of Rt 340/522S from I-66W.  From exit 6 off of Route 66W\, proceed south and turn right at about 1.2 miles.  There will be signs to Elizabeth Furnace Day Use area grounds.

I would describe this as a intermediate ride.
