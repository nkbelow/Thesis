1*Death Valley National Park*Death Valley*California*36.46187*-116.866296*0*There are few constructed trails here, but in a place this desolate you usually don't need them. Most hiking routes in the park are cross-country, up canyons, or along ridges. Although footing can be rough and rocky (wear boots), and dry falls may need to be scaled, thick brush is uncommon.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Source: National Park Service*The main road transecting Death Valley National Park from east to west is California Highway 190&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: National Park Service*16
2*Nadeau National Recreation Trail*Darwin*California*36.266748*-117.590632*0*The Nadeau Trail provides motorized access through western Panamint Valley and ties in with cherry-stems and spurs leading to OHV, wilderness hiking, and packing opportunities. The Nadeau Trail has a fascinating history, from a place of geologic unrest and prehistoric petroglyphs to acting as the main corridor for Remi Nadeau's freight wagons loaded with silver lead ingots headed down to Los Angeles in the 1800's. History seekers, cultural explorers, and desert recreationists have an unlimited number of possible stops along the trail.*5 miles east of Darwin, CA and 25 miles northeast of Ridgecrest, CA*16
3*Furnace Creek*Death Valley*California*36.463056*-116.867778*3*Furnace Creek Campground is in a central location in Death Valley National Park. It is popular for RV and group camping; tent sites are also available. A visitor center, bike path, hiking trails and an abandoned borax mine are nearby.      Death Valley is one of the lowest areas of land on Earth; Furnace Creek is at an elevation of 196 ft. below sea level. The region is generally sunny, dry and clear throughout the year. Winter (November through March) is the park&amp;amp;#39;s peak season; temperatures are mild with occasional winter storms, and visitors should bring warm clothing and light or medium jackets. Summers are known for their extremely hot and dry conditions; temperatures can soar up to 120 degrees.  Sun-protective clothing and a broad brimmed hat are recommended. Rainfall averages less than two inches per year.      Furnace Creek is the only campground in the park that takes reservations. Weekends over the winter holidays and spring break book up early; visitors should consider weekday reservations if their desired weekend is full.*Death Valley is in eastern California on the Nevada border, 130 miles west-northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada and 106 miles east of Lone Pine, California. Furnace Creek Campground is a half-mile north of Furnace Creek Visitor Center on State Highway 190.*16
4*Breakneck Pond Trail*Bar Harbor*Maine*44.41062*-68.25305*3*Basically the only trail on the entire island of Mt. Desert that MTB'ing is allowed on. Can be either a shuttled scorching downhill, or an out and back climb and descent (start at Hull's Cove General Store for the out and back).&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />This descent will take you past Upper and Lower Breakneck ponds, it can be wet and may require a crossing or two of creeks.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />You come out on a jeep trail, which then becomes Breakneck Rd. Follow the road down to Hull's Cove General Store for a tasty ice cold beverage!*Head west on Main St. in Bar Harbor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn right on Mt. Desert St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mt.

6*Acadia National Park*Bar Harbor*Maine*44.409137*-68.247729*125*Acadia is a hiker's paradise. Within the park, 125 miles of trails offer choices for all abilities and interests. From flat rambles across meadows to challenging climbs up iron rungs, you can find it here. Terrain varies from rugged shoreline and deep woods to open mountain summits with views of the ocean and outer islands. For those who prefer more level footing, 45 miles of carriage roads are excellent for walking.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Source: National Park Service*From Boston take I-95 north to Augusta, Maine, then Route 3 east to Ellsworth and on to Mount Desert Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: National Park Service*1
5*Acadia Carriage Roads*Bar Harbor*Maine*44.32066*-68.25325*45*OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.*There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.  In the off season, lodging from bed and breakfasts, to waterfront cabins, to KOA campgrounds can be found anywhere.  *1

10*Donnell Pond Public Reserved Land*Ellsworth*Maine*44.583306*-68.091251*105*Schoodic Mountain<br />Schoodic Mt. can be climbed as a loop (2.8 miles) or an up and back (2.5 miles). Allow 2 hours. The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain. The loop includes a roughly half-mile walk to Schoodic Beach from the parking area as well as 2.4 miles of hiking trail leading up to and back from the cliffs on the southwest flank of Black Mt. The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt. Trail, a 0.9 mile trail located approximately 1 mile down the Dynamite Brook Rd (accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield).<br /><br />Tunk Mountain<br />The new Tunk Mt. and Hidden Ponds Trails provide the opportunity to explore scenic ponds and climb a low but brawny mountain with inspiring views.<br /><br />The Tunk Mt. Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield. Hikers can link in to the Caribou Loop Trail by walking south on the Dynamite Brook Rd. for roughly one mile.<br /><br />Downeast Sunrise Trail<br />The Downeast Sunrise Trail is an 85-mile scenic rail trail running along the entire Downeast coastal area connecting multiple scenic conservation areas, intersecting salmon rivers, and providing year round recreation opportunities. It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers. Between Franklin and Cherryfield (where there are parking areas/trailheads), it passes through several sections of the Donnell Pond Public Lands. Shared-use roads open to vehicular and recreational trail use link the Sunrise Trail with other destinations within Donnell Pond Public Lands.*Access is twelve miles east of Ellsworth off Route 182 or 183.*1

Because of the length, it takes explorers a significant amount of time to reach the unexplored portions of the cavern, oftentimes requiring camping underground on expeditions of 4 or more days in length. According to Wikipedia, &quot;The discovered areas in the cave account for only about 2% of the estimated total air volume of the cave. The cave volume is estimated by measuring the amount of air that the cave &quot;exhales&quot; when the outside air pressure drops and &quot;inhales&quot; when the outside air pressure rises.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;<br />Jewel Cave contains all of the traditional speleothems, although not in as high of quantities as some other well-known caverns. Some of the unique formations include a hydromagnesite balloon, which is formed by a gas inflating this substance.&lt;br /&gt;<br />The cave is open for tours all year long. There are 3 different tours offered, varying in difficult from very easy, short tours to spelunking tours through undeveloped caverns.**55

The route will take you through every part of the park, allowing you to witness one of the most amazing preservation and conservation efforts in the world.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Free is good.  You don't need to buy a guide book.  Print this page and bring it with you.  Pick up a free trail map at the Harry Hampton Visitor Center.  Use both as a guide.  Also, register at the visitors center and let the rangers know your intentions.  You will need to obtain a free backcountry camping permit.  Congaree National Park is a designated wilderness area, and although backcountry camping is allowed, strict regulations apply.  Also, the Congaree River floods it's banks every once in a while, making passage on most of this route impossible.  It is best to simply call the park directly with questions and concerns, and for current trail conditions.

You have walked on every trail in the park except the Sims Trail, which is really a road anyway.  No big deal, right?&lt;br /&gt;<br />This route is only a suggestion.  Once you see the trail map you will know the variations available.  I suggest this route, however, because it is pretty simple to follow and it has a nice flow through the park.&lt;br /&gt;<br />There is one more thing about this route that is interesting.  You only have to carry your backpack on 9.7 of the 23.2 miles.  You can dump your pack prior to the Kingsnake Trail at bridge I, and then again prior to the River Trail around bridge F.

85*Indian Cove Campground*Twentynine Palms*California*34.12*-116.155833*3*Indian Cove Campground lies amid the huge, steep rock formations for which Joshua Tree National Park is known. Because of its proximity to many rock climbing routes, it is a popular camping location for climbers. Indian Cove is one of only two campgrounds in the park that can be reserved during the busy winter season; it is open on a first-come, first-served basis from June 1 through September 29.      Travelers who enjoy warm, dry winters flock to Joshua Tree from October through May, when temperatures hover between 70-90 degrees during the day and drop to a 40-60 degree range at night. Summer is the park&amp;amp;#39;s off-season due to the uncomfortably-high desert heat. Indian Cove is at an elevation of 3,200 feet.*Take Interstate 10 to State Highway 62. Turn south on Indian Cove Road. Follow the road into the campground. If coming from the east, follow Highway 62 approximately seven miles west of the city of Twentynine Palms and turn south onto Indian Cove Road.*33

101*Spruce R.R. Trail*Port Angeles*Washington*48.09339*-123.80275*11* This trail for the most part is all single track &amp; follows an old RR grade along the N shore of Lake Cresent. Occasionally it leaves the grade and runs along the lakes edge. A great trail for beginners or just a quick 11 mile workout with great scenery, this trail would probably be pretty crowded on summer weekends. Starting from the N shore picnic area (W end) the first 1.5 miles is along the dirt road to the end. Winding around the shore it gains and looses the same 100 ft a few times but no big climbs. Can be done as a one way with a second car or shuttle.<br />*W on 101 from Port Angeles, WA 25 miles to a right on East shore dr. 3 miles to the end/trailhead (parking- bathrooms).&lt;br /&gt;Option #2- follow 101 another 9 miles to a right at Fairholm, follow rd 3.3 miles to the N shore picnic area and park there.&lt;br /&gt;*44
112*Sims Trail, Congaree National Park*Hopkins*South Carolina*33.83085*-80.82328*5*4.6 miles of interesting walking using the Bluff Trail and Sims Trail as an out-and-back.  This is  good way to see new-growth forest and old-growth forest in the same hike.  The Bluff trail departs the After Hours parking lot and is easy walking to the junction with the Sims Trail.  From there, the walking is more like country road travel, all the way down to Cedar Creek.  Pick up a free trail map at the Harry Hampton Visitor Center before you start walking.  There are many combinations of trails that can be used.  You can easily turn the Sims Trail hike into a 'loop' hike by returning on the Weston Lake Loop Trail and Low Boardwalk.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Call the park directly for current trail conditions before you visit. Every once in a while, the Congaree River floods it's banks, making a hike on most of the Sims Trail impossible.

126*The Knot*Wedgefield*South Carolina*33.80493*-80.54781*5*The Knot features plenty of climbing, incredibly fast descents, and some breathtaking drop-offs overlooking the Poinsett Park Lake and Shank's Creek.  The trail was embraced and made possible largely due to the efforts of Park Manager Zabo McCants and members of the Sumter Chain Gang, Midlands SORBA, a special grant from IMBA, and many other volunteers.*From I-95: Take exit 119 (Manning exit) onto Hwy 261 towards Columbia until you see signs for Poinsett. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Columbia: Take Hwy 378/76 toward Sumter. After crossing over the Wateree River proceed to the top of the hill and turn rt. onto Hwy. 261 toward Wedgefield. Continue on Hwy 261 until you see signs for Poinsett.

48*Victoria's Secret*Rapid City*South Dakota*44.00568*-103.35191*10*From the triangle, ride in Victoria Lake Road. Cross the the cattle guard and after a tenth of a mile, look for a jeep road on the right. About 20 yards in there is a large rock placed to block vehicle access.&lt;br /&gt;<br />From here the trail is fairly well defined, and there are signs as needed. Initially arrows on small, white signs, and later orange paint on trees, then back to the signs. &lt;br /&gt;<br />There are a couple of navigational gotchas: &lt;br /&gt;<br />First, at 5.8 miles, immediately after crossing a creek bed on a short section of jeep road, look to the right. The trail goes back to singletrack here and the sign for the turn is easy to miss.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Second, you will come to a well defined jeep road (the same road you left after the creek bed) and it will be unclear which way to go. Go right for a short distance and look for the orange paint on several trees on the left side of the road. Continue the singletrack here. &lt;br /&gt;<br />Heading on, the trail continues to be well defined, and most of the intersections are marked with orange paint, cairns, or signs. There are a couple of singletrack intersections that are not marked, but either go straight, or take the one that is obviously more traveled. It's easy to get a little lost, even using the printed directions from the local club's website, so it is HIGHLY recommend to download the GPX file from here and load it into a smartphone or GPS device.&lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail itself is a solid intermediate ride with lots of rocks, both loose and embedded. There are some small ledges and a handful of mild switchbacks. The few technical features are well marked, giving riders enough time to either dismount and check them out, or let out a WHOOP and drop in. 100% of this trail is ridable, including the tech features once you scope out your line.&lt;br /&gt;<br />The terrain is rolling with short, fairly steep descents immediately followed by quick, punchy climbs. The scenery is amazing as you traverse deep forest, hillside meadows, and the tops of several cliffs. There are lots of sharp rocks, so tubeless tires are ideal. With tubes, run slightly higher pressure to help avoid pinch flats.&lt;br /&gt;<br />There is cell service only on the ridgetops, and there is not much traffic, so keep that in mind if riding it alone. Also, there is poison ivy everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;<br />The trail is a 'lollypop' with a very short stem consisting of the doubletrack just off of Victoria Lake Road, as well as the short section of road leading back to the parking area.*From Rapid City:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head south on US-16 W/Mt Rushmore Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turn right onto Moon Meadows Dr. It is next to the Black Hills National Forest Research Facility and 4.3 miles from the Colonial House Restaurant back in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go 2.3 miles, then turn right onto Dunsmore Rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go .1 miles and turn left on to Sheridan Lake Rd. It's a 'T' intersection with a convenience store on the left.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go about 3 and a half miles and look for Victoria Lake Rd on the right. It's a triangle entrance, and there is parking area the triangle.*55
58*San Miguel Island*Ventura*California*34.039722*-120.374444*3*San Miguel Island has a wealth of natural and cultural treasures. Its ocean-sculpted landscape and more than 500 relatively undisturbed archeological sites, make it a valued part of the Channel Islands National Park and the National Register of Historic Places. Plus its picture-perfect hikes make it a pleasing destination for campers and day-trippers alike.       Remnants of early inhabitants date back thousands of years, and fossils of the Pygmy Mammoth have been discovered here. Hikers can take a 16-mile roundtrip hike to Point Bennett to overlook fantastic, undisturbed beaches where hundreds of seals and sea lions bask in the sun. The same rewarding hike cuts through some of the best caliche forests in the Channel Islands. The Caliche Forest is a sprawl of petrified tree roots created from deposits of calcium carbonate.*Island can be reached by boat from Ventura Harbor.*12

107*GATE 5 Trailhead*Columbia*South Carolina*33.98651*-80.88924*8*The Fort Jackson passage of South Carolina's Palmetto Trail is a winding trail that has some sections of shoulder width tree passages and some relatively easy ascents and descents. The trail follows parallel to Leesburg Road almost the entire duration of the passage, but lies off of the road enough to enjoy the scenery. The first part of the trail from the kiosk is well traveled with foot traffic, but tapers to almost no use at all for the latter part of the trail. This is a fresh trail as of 1999 and is still a true singletrack with some very good maintenance. The eastern part of Columbia's soil consists almost entirely of sand, but this trail defies the stereotypical drags of riding on sand. The trail is well marked with trail signs and yellow flashes on the trees.*Fort Jackson Gate 5*13
117*Campbells Pond*Wedgefield*South Carolina*33.80468*-80.52635*4*This is a great trail; in fact, all the ones in this park are awesome.  Campbell's Pond, though, is a little more technical with more climbing.  It's full of roots and rocks, too.<br /><br />For an out and back, it is great. Most are boring on the way back, but not this one.  They actually include some route diversions to make it interesting.  It is really well marked, too.  Although it's not as fast as K-3, you can still get up some speed.  You'll need it when you hit the Kamikaze, a big dip on the way.  You'll want all you can get on the Devil's Backbone...not as dangerous as it sounds, but can be great fun if you rail into it.*For better directions, look up the Killer Three Loop, which is one of three trails at Manchester State park.*13

I've included the gpx we took and the map as an image here.&lt;br /&gt;<br />We road up the east side of Buzzard's loop trail, which was quite rocky at the bottom, but smoothed somewhat as we went up.  This trail system is quite rocky.  Then we took the &quot;green&quot; trail, along the top.  Then back down North Buzzard, with a loop out Therapist and then down the bottom of Jack's.  Then finished on the bottom of North Buzzard.  While North Buzzard is technically mild, sections to climb pretty steep.  The trails are rated from green to &quot;red&quot;, which is defined as &quot;severe&quot;.  Didn't ride any of those.&lt;br /&gt;<br />We cut the ride a bit short, due to the rocky nature.  We felt pretty beat up doing the 4 miles or so we road.  &lt;br /&gt;<br />As the other website says, this is typical of trails in this area; quite rocky.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Likely wouldn't go out of our way to ride it again.*From Rapid City, take Hwy 44 west for about 5 miles.

On the way, find nesting seabirds, sea lions and seals, and many other animals and plants on the island. The landscape varies from pine forests, to grasslands and marshes. Chaparral, a region of shrubland, unique to California, also decorates the rolling hills.       How did the island get its name? Legend has it that in 1769, a Spanish priest accidentally left his cross-tipped staff on the island. A Chumash Indian found it and returned the staff to its rightful owner. The Spaniards were so impressed that they named the island after the good deed: the Island of the Sacred Cross.*To park headquarters in Ventura, CA HIGHWAY 101, exit Victoria or SEAWARD to Ventura Harbor.*12

128*Santee State Park*Santee*South Carolina*33.525347*-80.505908*6*Great little trail loop near I-95.  Not much else around the area for mountain bikers but this trails makes the best out of the flat terrain.  About 2 miles of the loop is on wide singletrack, the rest is on twisty and at times tight singletrack in the dense pine forest.  Be sure to wear your helmet, not because you might fall but because there are tons of low branches on this infrequently maintained trail.  At times the trail is hard to follow and you'll find several unexpected twists and turns as you build up speed.  Overall a nice place to ride, perfect for those new to the sport.*From I-95: Take exit 98 to Hwy 6 toward Elloree, the park is located 1 mi. W. of the town of Santee.*13

200*Lost Lake Tr*Seward*Alaska*60.1726*-149.41046*7*"This trail does get easier the farther up it you go. I give it a fairly high technical rating due mainly to some rough/rocky sections, sections with lots of roots, some sections with both, that and 1800 ft of climbing in 6 miles is not really a beginner type ride.<br /><br />Immediately upon starting up the trail take a right and follow this route for the first mile, the two join back up at that point. Shortly after that you come to another Y dividing the summer &amp; winter routes, stay left. The trail climbs steadily through densely forested canyons hugging hillsides and crossing a couple small streams. At 2 miles and about 1000 ft you will have just about reached treeline and the forest gives way to thick alder, tall grass and raspberry bushes. The first 3 miles are definitely the roughest and the trail flattens out and gets considerably smoother at 3.5 miles, here there is a Y and the upper end of the 'winter route', stay left. The thick alder have given way to classic tundra and a few scattered stands of spruce trees here &amp; there. Although still a healthy climb the smoother trail conditions make the next 2.5 miles to the summit go much easier, make sure to look over your shoulder now &amp; then at the views of the Kenai Range to the W, Resurrection Bay and Seward to the S and the many glaciers of the Harding Icefield to the E. The sound of a hundred waterfalls in the distance has been your soundtrack for the last few miles. At 6 miles you reach the summit of the trail and can see Lost Lake sitting in a mountain bowl another mile down the trail and a couple hundred ft lower. <br /><br />The trip back down the mountain can of course be a blast, although the roughness on the lower half can really work out any suspension.<br /><br />*** This is bear country!

202*Last Chance*Carlsbad*New Mexico*32.23756*-104.70544*0*There are two ways you can go from the trailhead, north or south. I went north on the Last Chance trail, very rocky full of cactus.  It's easier if one takes the jeep road just before you get to the trail head. You can start ridding from there. The trail is very well marked and easy to stay on. Some short steep uphills, will probably need to dismount on some. The trail runs mostly at the bottom of a canyon with spectacular sights.The trail runs for about 5 miles but I did not go that far. At one point after the 2.2 miles the trail shoots straight up a side of a hill which I dare not go for fear of walking my bike for too long. The ride back to trail head is a blast as you ride downhill most of the way. At 2.2 mile marker you have the option of taking a trail south which in turn will take you to some other trails. I did not go that way as it seemed to steep. *From Carslbad travel to Lincoln National Forest to the Sitting Bull Waterfall campground, marked on any New Mexico map.

209*Sidewinder*Olathe*Colorado*38.59656*-107.88875*21*This trail description is South-to-North. You will want a shuttle vehicle at the other trailhead off H75 Road. We used Peach Valley Road to drop the shuttle at that end.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Sidewinder Trail is a relentless, rocky, technical, physical adventure on the bike. There are very few extended climbs or downhills, but my GPS still measured 2500' of climbing and 3000' of total descending by the time we were done.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Mostly it is a constant mind-game of rocky, technical bike-handling tests. There are very few sections of fast cruising. The trail is extremely well-built though so the technical challenges are mostly rideable for a skilled rider. There were 6 of us on our ride and while we were all bucked-off at various places, usually a couple of us would clean most features. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />As the name implies, the Sidewinder weaves in and out of many arroyos as you cling to the western edge of the Gunnison Gorge Wilderness Area. You will climb and descend these arroyos enjoying many slickrock drops and ledges along the way, as well as about a thousand other rocky treats.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The Sidewinder is not for beginners. I would imagine they would hate it and probably wind up hurt. For a rider loving a technical, physical workout its one of the best trails I've ever ridden. It took our group 5 hours to ride the whole thing including all our breaks and lunch and all that. If you google &quot;Sidewinder Trail&quot; then you will find a map on the BLM website that shows the route and many other bailout options.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Go ride it... you will not be disappointed.*Take Hwy 50 to the town of Olathe. You could also ride this trail from Delta to Olathe, but I highly recommend riding it South-to-North from near Olathe and towards Delta for a little more net downhill on the trail&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Olathe, turn east on Falcon road and drive about 4 miles. Make a left when you come to Peach Valley Rd. After about a mile you will see a parking area on your right with a road leading up into the sandy hills. Park here and ride the bike up the sandy hill climbing for a few hundred feet.

Very soon after that right you will find the beginning of the singletrack Sidewinder trail beginning its climb up the hillside on your left.*7

The trail is fairly smooth and has nice flow as it crosses up and over small ridges and down through gullies. A couple spots have been rerouted for vegetation rehabilitation but these are clearly marked. At about 1.7 miles you will run into a very sandy hill, this sand section will last just about 100 yards and then is done, in the middle of it is an intersection with the Spanish Wash trail, any equestrian traffic that has been on the trail will more than likely exit here. Continuing on stay right on the main trail when you encounter a small singletrack that takes off to the left. The intersection with the Church Rocks trail will be an obvious T, although ride-able either direction I recommend taking a right and doing the loop counter-clockwise. You will ride back towards the north for about a mile but higher up on the hillside so there are more slickrock sections mixed in. You will come to a large U turn and the trail goes up a short but steep rock section and then takes off south up the ledge. Once on top you have over a mile of slick rock ledges and bowls to play in all the while making your way south down the ridge.

Its advisable to go down the wash to get off of the ridge and start heading back north.

There will be a couple different routes up the slick rock, just follow the tire tracks in the sand or make your own fun route, they all end up towards the top at the same place. Just look for the main trail at the top of the hill marked by large carins and all the other tire tracks, follow it north back to the Prospector trail.&lt;br /&gt;<br />*The Church Rocks trail is about a 3 mile, mostly slickrock loop, and although there are a couple other access routes due to parking issues etc., the Prospector trail is the most popular route to get to it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From St. George head north on I-15 to exit 16, the hwy 9 towards Hurricane exit.

261*J.E.M. Trail*Hurricane*Utah*37.20023*-113.21773*13*This trail is a combination of a network of trails. I rode it counter clockwise. I starts out with the Gould Rim, then on to the JEM trail, and finally to Hurricane Rim. This is a great intermediate ride. Very fast, rolling hills. Not a lot of climbing. If you dont want to do the whole 21 miles, consider just doing the JEM trail out and back. <br /><br />&lt;b&gt;Description from justin70:&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />This trail is a combination of trails. It is usually ridden counter-clockwise, so that the JEM trail is ridden down-hill. There are a number of trail heads that can be used.<br /><br />By doing the whole network (Hurricane Rim, Gould's Rim, JEM Trail), you get a 22 mile epic cross country loop.<br /><br />I recommend parking at the Virgin trailhead for JEM - that way, you get to finish the ride with JEM, which has the best flow, is the funnest of the three, and is primarily downhill. <br /><br />Turn right off of State Road 9 onto Sheep Bridge Road just before you enter Virgin, Utah. Cross the Virgin River and take the first right after the cattle guard. Follow the two track to the end (this is the trailhead).<br /><br />Start riding going west on the Hurricane Rim, which has the most technical bits and the biggest climb. Transition to the Gould's Rim, which has some tech, some doubletrack, and some flowy BMX-style ups and downs. Then finish with the JEM, which is a mostly big-ring affair, except for the one very technical drop from the top into the wash.<br /><br />This trail as a loop demands respect. It includes rocks, distance, desert weather, vertical exposure and remoteness. Take adequate food, water and spares and ride with care.*From the town of Hurricane, head west on highway 59 towards Lake Powell. After only about 1/2 mile up a steep hill, park in the parking lot at the top next to the Radio towers. This is the trail head. *59

438*Hellroaring Peak*Whitefish*Montana*48.483034*-114.355914*0*Hellroaring Peak offers backcountry lines for downhill skiing and snowboarding which are easily accessible from Whitefish Mountain Resort (Big Mountain). &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />To get there, from the summit of Big Mountain take the cat track out around the far side of Hellroaring basin. Assuming it's already part way through the season, there should be an obvious trail blazed out the side of the resort into the backcountry. Follow this traverse a ways. Eventually, it will dump out into a snowmobile trail. Continue to follow this trail for a ways, and you will see Hellroaring Peak as you approach it. Eventually another traverse will split off of the snowmobile trail--jump on that. That trail will split, and a steep skin track/boot pack will climb up one way to the top of Hellroaring Peak, and a traverse will continue out onto into the middle of the main face. If you want maximum elevation and the best views, hike to the top, but the upper section of skiing before you cross the traverse isn't very steep. The grade steepens below the traverse, so most of the best skiing is accessible with rather minimal effort. Shred down the face and enjoy the pow! As you enter the trees below, follow the tracks and try to bear roughly to the left, and you should be able to reenter the resort at the bottom of Hellroaring Basin, catching the Hellroaring chair back out.**21

498*Thunder Mountain*Red Canyon*Utah*37.74256*-112.33074*16*This trail can be done as a loop or if you have enough vehicles start ride at Coyote Hollow Trailhead parking.&lt;br /&gt;<br />Starting from the Thunder Mountain TH (aprox 7100 ft., restrooms, parking) ride E on the paved trail that follows river (#113) for 5.4 miles then turn on to dirt road and follow it 2 miles through a small campground to Coyote Hollow parking (8050 ft., restrooms, parking). The Thunder Mountain single track (#098) starts here winding through forest canyons climbing and descending the same 250 ft many times for the next 3 miles. The trail gradually climbs to roughly 8300 ft at 10.5 miles from the start (awesome views!) and then starts a rapid decent past red cliffs &amp; hoodooï¿½s, switchbacking down the canyons. Some technical stuff as the switchbacks are rather tight &amp; steep and some of the trail is very narrow along ledges.

541*Steptoe Creek Trail*Ely, Nv*Nevada*39.18351*-114.7207*3*Steptoe Creek Trail&lt;br /&gt;<br />Difficulty: More Difficult&lt;br /&gt;<br />Length: 3 miles (out and back), 150' elevation gain&lt;br /&gt;<br />Notes: The narrowness of the trail and the steeper side slope make this a bit &lt;br /&gt;<br />more challenging, not a ton of climbing though. For a longer outing combine this &lt;br /&gt;<br />with the Cave Creek Trail.*Getting There: From Ely head south on Hwy 50/93 for 7 miles. Take a left and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;follow the signs to Cave Lake State Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for Steptoe Creek Trail: As you are driving up State Route 486 to Cave &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lake State Park you will see a numer of turnouts on your right. Park at the last &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one before you get to the paved road that goes up to the actual lake. You'll see a &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wood sign in front of you for the Steptoe Creek Trail. Follow the trail, parallelling &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the road you just came up. When you get to the end either turn around and go &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;back on the trail or hop onto the paved road to get back to your car that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*25
553*Phil's World*Cortez*Colorado*37.34843*-108.49922*27*The trail is pure hard-pack singletrack, with about 750' overall elevation, although climbs are never greater than about .5mi and 200' elevation. Go through the gates near the parking lot, take the intro section and turn left at the arrow (next set of gates), follow left through the track and you'll have a great time. <br /><br />The track is very fast, well-maintained and has a lot of great sections, including a rollercoaster section that allows you to get great speed and some air if you take them hard, and also some sweet jumps later on in the course. we had to backtrack about 4 times just to rehit a lot of the sweet sections. There is nothing exceptionally technical, just really fast and fun. The landscape is generally colorado desert, with some nice track along the rims of the cliffs and through some waist high juniper trees. This is a great track, and more than work the drive from Durango. After riding three trails there, this was a fantastic. All the locals we talked to recommended it, and I recommend getting a trail map from the local shop. There are many more trails in the Cortez area to be explored.*Right off of 160W between a shooting range and the Fairgrounds (the drive in is a little hidden, but next door to the shooting range, and practically across the street from the Fairgrounds). This is about 45 minutes from Durango.*41
559*Big Canyon*Durango*Colorado*37.23079*-107.86122*2*A tight, curvey trail leads to the granview network. I like to ride this down and out to the rail head as an ending point for a loop starting in Horse Gulch, up and over Telegraph.*Dirve out Hwy 160 east, turn left at Wall mart and left again at the stop sign. A parking area is on the left. Trail is across the street. I prefer to start in town and end on big canyon then take hwy 3 or the Animas River Trail back to town. You can start from here and access the grandview area.*41
569*Elephant Head*Tucson*Arizona*31.76514*-110.96732*13*The Elephant Head Mountain Bike Route is a combination of little-traveled roads and remote trails designed especially for these versatile, muscle-powered vehicles. Winding across the scenic foothills of the Santa Rita Mountains in the shadow of the dramatic landmark for which it was named, the route was designed both to challenge a rider's skill and to provide a scenic, backcountry experience.<br /><br />One end of the ride is at the mouth of Madera Canyon Recreation Area. The other is at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitor Center on the road to the top of Mount Hopkins.<br /><br />From the Madera Canyon trailhead, the ride follows old jeep tracks across the desert grasslands and mesquite flats to the base of Elephant Head Rock, where it turns into a single-track trail. As the trail curls around the Rock, it heads up Chino Canyon into Chino Basin along a steep old mining road.<br /><br />At the top of the climb to Chino Basin, the ride turns south along a rugged mountain trail over a saddle then down a nice grade into Agua Caliente Canyon. After crossing Agua Caliente Creek, the route leads along a couple of little-used forest roads around a couple of foothills that mark the western limits of the Santa Rita Range. The ride ends at the Whipple Observatory Visitors Center where water and restrooms are available. Or you can just make a quick turn around in the parking lot and do it all over again in the opposite direction.<br /><br />Equestrians and hikers also use this trail, and vehicles use the 4-wheel drive roads, so be alert for hazards.<br /><br />Before visiting this trail, call the Nogales Ranger District for current trail conditions which can vary with season, weather and maintenance status. Always let someone know where you'll be hiking/riding and when you plan to return.*"    *  To Madera Canyon Trailhead: Leave Interstate 19 at the Continental Road/Madera Canyon Exit. Turn east and follow the Madera Canyon signs about 11 miles to the Proctor Road Parking area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    * To Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory Visitor Center Trailhead: Leave Interstate 19 at the Canoa Road Exit. Take the east frontage road 3 miles south to Elephant Head Road and turn east 1.6 miles to the Mt. Hopkins Road. Turn south and drive 5.5 miles to the Visitor Center. Park outside the gate at the trailhead parking area and ride up the road to FR 4077. Turn north on this unmaintained Forest Service road and follow the mountain bike signs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"*49
528*Cold Springs*Alta, Wy*Wyoming*43.7637*-110.99961*8*Trail is easiet down as a loop but can be done as a shuttle as well.  Take a &lt;br /&gt;<br />right into Teton Canyon and park at the first big parking lot on the left.  &lt;br /&gt;<br />About 50 yards from Ski Hill rd.  Then ride you bike up Skill Hill Rd about 3.2 &lt;br /&gt;<br />miles.  Trail starts on your right on a jeep road.  The road climb up isn't as &lt;br /&gt;<br />bad as it looks (roughly 30min).  After you go down the jeep road there will &lt;br /&gt;<br />be a brown carsonite sign indicating a trail on your left.  Take the &lt;br /&gt;<br />singletrack trail and follow it.  Trail will wind up and down through the forest &lt;br /&gt;<br />for around 2 miles.  At the trail junction in the meadow take a right.  This &lt;br /&gt;<br />will put you onto Mill Creek trail which leads back to Teton Canyon.  Once &lt;br /&gt;<br />you hit the road take a right and head back up .5-1 mile to your car.*Trail starts 3 miles up Ski Hill Rd after you pass the Teton Canyon Turnoff.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Located about 6 miles east of Driggs, ID.  Trail is on the right at a jeep road &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;turnoff.  Sometimes there is a sign that says Mill Creek (but not always). The is &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;another jeep road on the left of road as well.*24

545*Cave Creek Trail*Ely *Nevada*39.1943*-114.696*4*Cave Creek Trail&lt;br /&gt;<br />Difficulty: Easiest&lt;br /&gt;<br />Length: 3.7 miles (loop), 590' elevation gain&lt;br /&gt;<br />Notes: The most difficult part again is the altitude combined with a little bit of &lt;br /&gt;<br />climbing, if you get through that part the trail itself is quite easy. For a longer &lt;br /&gt;<br />outing combine this with the Steptoe Creek Trail.*Getting There: From Ely head south on Hwy 50/93 for 7 miles. Take a left and &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;follow the signs to Cave Lake State Park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for Cave Creek Trail, Loop: Park at the trailhead just past the paved &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;road on your right that goes up to the actual lake. There will be a trailhead with a &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;kiosk. You'll see a trail coming in across the creek in front of you, this is the Cave &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creek Trail. To do a loop I would recommend heading up the paved road past the &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lake to where it turns to dirt. Go for another .8 miles until you see a two-track dirt &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;road on your left. Go up this and climb for about 1.8 miles until you see signs for &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Cave Creek Trail. Go left and follow the trail back to where you parked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*25

Meadow loop is mostly flat, open meadow and scrub brush.  Stacy's Loop gets a a little more technical.  Take a Right onto Stacy's Loop.  Mike's Trails is a little more difficult.  Right onto Mike's Trail.  Get a little altitude here - gives a good view of the meadow.  Now with the junction with Cuchillo Trail.  I opted a Right turn.  This was a steep trail.  Probably should have taken the Left.  Cuchillo takes you back to Meadow Loop and the Horse Gulch gravel road.*Park at the Horse Gulch Trailhead. Take College to 8th, turn right by Durango Natural Foods. Turn left again on 3rd by Building Specialties. Park and ride up Horse Gulch Road, the rocky doubletrack 0.6 mile.

At the end of this trail you reach the service road. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />At this point you need to go RIGHT in order to reach Waipoli Rd. that takes &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />you down to Highway 377. Waipoli Rd. is amazing fast fun, and at times you &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />can reach speeds of 50mph. And at the end of this road you will reach the &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />Highway and wait for your ride. *From the Airport you need to get on Haleakala Highway or 37 (same thing). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then get onto Highway 377 and take this all the way to Crater Rd. and this &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will take you to the top of Haleakala at 10,023ft. *29

552*Telegraph Trail System - South*Durango*Colorado*37.22401*-107.85639*10*The Telegraph Trail System is a fantastic riding area located virtually in town! The &quot;Trails 2000&quot; organization has done a great job building and maintaining these trails. These are the trails that your bike is begging you to take a ride on! The Telegraph Trails are laid out in multiple loops with multiple trail heads that allow you to combine trails and mileage to match your desires. In and out of canyons and meadows with Scrub Oak, Juniper and Pine on great single track. The switchbacks in and out of the canyons get the legs to burning but are short and manageable. Each intersection has &quot;You Are Here&quot; maps so you always know where you are. There is no specific direction or route you must take (go ahead and create your own) but a favorite 10-mile combination loop we enjoy starts at the Sale Barn trail head and ends at the Big Canyon trail head with a short frontage road ride back to the car.&lt;br /&gt;<br />From the Sale Barn trail head follow the Sale Barn trail through a couple of canyons and meadows and turn right at the first intersection onto the Cowboy trail. Follow this trail up to intersection 2 and turn right again, staying on the Cowboy trail. Turn left at intersection 3 and turn left at intersection 4 onto the Sidewinder trail. Breeze along the Sidewinder trail and turn left at intersection 5 and again left at intersection 6 onto the South Rim trail. Great views of the South side of Durango can be seen from along this ridge. Continue around and down on the South Rim trail until intersection 7 and turn right onto the Big Canyon trail. Blast down a great finishing stretch that drops you in and out of creek beds until you finally reach the bottom and the Big Canyon trail head. Turn left on the frontage road and cool down on the ride back you your car. Be sure to watch for hikers, horses and other bikers.&lt;br /&gt;*The Sale Barn trail head is located across from the Home Depot on US550/160 (S Camino Del Rio) at the Southern end of Durango. There is a sign at the turnoff from the highway onto a frontage road. Pull into the gravel parking lot up the hill on the right.*41

You can do any amount of miles that you wish. The trails are great for beginners, quick rides after work and night rides. If you feel you are getting lost, just head back toward the mountain. There are also paved roads to get you back to your car if you get tired of the trails.*From I-10 take Speedway west. Follow Speedway over Gates Pass.

The cabin was built in 1908 and was operated by the same family for six decades before it became a Forest Service property.    In collaboration with the Frontier Pathways Scenic and Historic Byway and the Colorado State Historical Society, the cabin and neighboring barn have been renovated to match their original appearance and filled with period-specific furniture and antiques. Electricity is provided and a horse corral is onsite.*Southwest of Pueblo, Colorado: Take HWY 96 approximately 30 milesthrough Wetmore to McKenzie Junction.

This trail is always steep up or down and always rocky *From 32nd turn West and go dowm two or three blocks until the road dead ends turn right and follow the road until pavement ends. From there it's pretty obvious where the trail is.*41
567*Milagrosa / Molino Basin*Tucson*Arizona*32.33751*-110.69045*20*This trail drops down into the basin and you can either climb back out, or connect to the Arizona trail. The Arizona trail will take you out to Reddington Pass, at which point you have to take the dirt road back into town. Taking the AZ trail requires parking one car at the bottom of the road to Reddington Pass and shuttling to Mt Lemmon. I think the total ride distance is close to 20 miles if you go out Reddington Pass.*Take the Mount Lemmon Highway to Molino Basin (mile 5.6). Park at the Molino Basin campground parking lot. The trailhead is across Mt Lemmon Hwy from the parking lot.*49
576*Shenandoah River State Park*Bentonville*Virginia*38.845*-78.301389*3* The park is 1,604 acres with 5.6 miles of river frontage along the  south fork of the Shenandoah River. The rolling, mountainous land  features steep slopes and is mostly wooded. In addition to meandering river frontage, the park offers scenic vistas overlooking Massanutten Mountain to the west and Shenandoah National Park to the east.     This park offers the following facilities year-round: camping, camp cabins, full-service cabins and one 6-bedroom large cabin/retreat.*The park is in Warren County, eight miles south of Front Royal and 15 miles north of Luray, just off U.S. Route 340 in Bentonville.

586*Bear Bottom Loop*Front Royal*Virginia*38.84768*-78.30591*5*There are a number of trails the network of trails I took began with the Bear Bottom Loop. That loop is clearly marked with blue tags. You can add some length to this train by taking the Big Oak Loop. All of the trails circle back. The map you get at the gate is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />These trails were alot of fun with some great ups and downs. There are some nice climbs and good curves. I would describe this as a intermediate ride. The only downside is that this is a multi-use trail and on the weekends there are normally horses and what horses leave.&lt;br /&gt;<br />*This place is about an hour from Washington DC. This park is also near Shenandoah National Park which has some good hikes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Front Royal Virginia take 340 South for eight miles. There will be a large sign on the right for Shenandoah State Park. At the gate to the park you can get a map of all the trails in the park. Also it is $3 per car. *51
601*Strasburg Reservoir*Front Royal*Virginia*38.92086*-78.38044*5*Nice fire road with gentle ascending grade to the reservoir. Great for kids and out of shape adults. If you bring kids, bring some fishing poles as the reservoir is rarely fished, so kids will have non-stop action there with the small fish. I have seen people swim there, although I am not sure how safe it is. This is the end of the Signal Knob trail noted elsewhere, but for those looking for something less epic, it is a pretty cool place to visit.*55 West of Front Royal, Left on Fort Valley Rd, Past Signal Knob parking about 8 miles to right on Boyer. Bear Right on Mine Mountain Lane, then right again on Fire Rd. Follow fire road until you get to a closed gate and park there. We were able to negotiate the fire road in a van, so it is not that bad - you just have to be careful to not bottom out on the crest of the road.*51

580*Mathews Arm Campground (va)**Virginia*38.763889*-78.2925*3*Secluded in the thick trees and rolling hills of the Shenandoah National Park, Mathews Arm Campground is the ideal spot for a camping getaway.*From Washington, D.C. metro area, travel west on Interstate 66 to exit 43A. Take US Highway 29 South to Warrenton, Virginia, then take US Highway 211 west for 28 miles to Shenandoah National Park and Skyline Drive Thornton Gap Entrance.

Follow Skyline Drive North approximately 9 miles and turn left into Mathews Arm Campground.*51
583*Kennedy Peak*Edinburg*Virginia*38.72806*-78.51506*10*This is a very rocky, continually challenging trail.  Stephen's trail alternates between flowy singletrack and rock garden mania.  It sidehills a few miles, then you start to veer east and make the climb to the ridgetop.  The climb is nothing less than brutal in places.  The combination of grade and technical requirements will force most off their bikes a time or two, but it's a great ride.  When you hit the ridgetop, go right on the Massanutten trail.  Again, more cool singletrack and and rock gardens with an occasional view of the valley between Massanutten and Shenandoah.  There's an optional out-and-back to the top of Kennedy peak which may or may not be worth it depending on your fitness level and desire for more miles and technical riding.  Keep following the Massanuten trail--it'll turn into double track for a while before dropping you out on 675.  Never fear, upon taking a right on 675, there is an almost immediate singletrack to the right and you're right back in the woods for some very technical rutted and rocky singletrack, some of which is just painful but most of which is just plain fun.  This singletrack will deliver you back to the access road to the parking lot.  &lt;br /&gt;<br />This ride is a lot like it's more famous neighbor, Elizabeth Furnace.  While the last descent on Elizabeth Furnace is longer and more varied, this ride has two thing going for it over Elizabeth Furnace.  First, it's all singletrack; you don't need miles of fire road to make a legitimate loop.  Second, while there are some real technical challenges, even for advanced riders, you won't spend nearly as much time on mandatory hike-a-bikes.  It also gets a lot less traffic; well worth the extra trouble to find it.*On I-81, take the Edinburg exit and head East.  When the road Ts in Town, go left.  In less than a mile, look for the sign indicating state route 675 to the right.  Turn here and follow the signs--you will have to make a number of turns and take a few forks, but you're staying in 675 the whole way.  After 9 or 10 miles, you'll see Camp Roosevelt on the left.  Keep going and look for the access road on the left shortly thereafter.  Park in the lot at the end of the road.  Stephen's Trail begins on the North end of the parking area.  *51

Continue 1 1/2 miles into resort.*51
611*Indian (1300)*Cuchara*Colorado*37.46008*-105.13122*14*This is an ATV track that winds its way thru the mountains and forest on the leeward side of the Sangreís for 14 miles from Forest Service road 421 on the north end down to the Bear Lake campground at the end of Forest Service Road 413 to the south.  This is a scenic area with the Spanish Peaks across the valley to the east and the high Sangre de Cristos to the southwest.  When I arrived at the north trailhead I was disappointed to see that it was an ATV track up into the trees.  I tend to be a singletrack snob, and I usually donít like to ride trails popular with the throttle twisting types ñ churned up dirt and rocks isnít my idea of a fun way to spend the day ñ but this trail turned out to be firm track the whole way.  If you choose to ride the north portion of the trail you better bring your climbing legs ñ it goes from 8,500 to 10,500 feet in about six miles.  The trail is in good shape, so it is mostly just a matter of sitting in the saddle and cranking, but it is a long climb, especially if you arenít used to the altitude.  From that first summit you descend on fairly fast doubletrack 500 vertical feet into Bonnett Park and then do a slow and easy ascent for the next eight miles up over the next ridge to the campground, at about 10,500í.<br /><br />There are a few alternate routes to consider.  If you want to skip the 2,000í climb out of the north trailhead you may want to start at the Spring Creek trailhead on the south side of the town of Cuchara.  From there it is about four miles uphill on the Dodge Ton Trail (1302) to where it joins the Indian Trail a bit south of Bonnet Park.  Or, similarly, the Baker Creek Trail (1301) further south of Cuchara connects into the Indian Trail a few miles further south.  I have never done it, but if you really want to make an epic day out of it you can almost double the miles by continuing south from the Bear Lake campground to the Trenchara Peak road (436), go up that road and pick up the North Fork Trail (1309) and ride it to the Purgatoire Campground on North Fork Road (34).  While you are at it, what the heck, take the lung-busting road all the way to the saddle on the north side of Trenchera Peak (13,517í).*Take highway 12 south thru La Veta; on the south side of town you will find Forest Road 421 heading west into the mountains.  Take that road about eight miles or so till you find the obvious trailhead and parking area.*26
623*Zapata Falls*Alamosa*Colorado*37.62151*-105.5608*4*This is a series of four stacked loops.  They are all fairly easy, but very bumpy with plenty of small, mostly loose rocks.  There are maps at most intersections, but some of them are faded and not always legible.  *From Alamosa, take 160 east until the intersection to 150 heading north to the Sand Dunes National Monument.  10.7 miles north (about 3 miles before the Monument) there will be a dirt road heading east toward the Sangre De Christo Mountians.  There shoudl be a sign indicating the road to Zapata Falls.  Follow this road about 3.5 miles to a large parking area.

591*Grand Caverns*Grottoes*Virginia*38.25833*-78.833179*0*Grand Caverns is the United States' oldest show cave, having been in business since 1806. The cave is 3.78 miles long and features numerous speleothems, including an unusual number of unusually high-quality shield formations. According to Wikipedia, &quot;It is also replete with stalactites, stalagmites, columns (where stalactites and stalagmites meet), draperies and other flowstone formations. The most stately room, &quot;Cathedral Hall&quot;, is 280 feet long and over 70 feet (21 m) high. It is one of the largest rooms of any cavern in the Eastern United States. Other sights include &quot;Bridal Veil&quot;, &quot;Stonewall Jackson's Horse&quot;, the &quot;Tapestry Room&quot;, and &quot;Dante's Inferno&quot;.&quot;**51
602*Shenandoah River State Park*Bentonville*Virginia*38.8477*-78.30617*26*There is a network of trails here.  The trails are multi use.  All of the trails &lt;br /&gt;<br />are as wide as double track but mostly smooth.  There are places where &lt;br /&gt;<br />you could easily fit 3 horses shoulder to shoulder across the trail.  The trails &lt;br /&gt;<br />do not have any remarkable features or technical challenge.  However the &lt;br /&gt;<br />sheer size of the area and the moderate climbs and ripping fun downhills &lt;br /&gt;<br />make this a fun trip.  It isn't going to satisfy single track purists looking for a &lt;br /&gt;<br />the next best trail.  But everyone else would probably enjoy it IF single &lt;br /&gt;<br />track is not a priority.  The trails are pretty smooth overall, a few have some &lt;br /&gt;<br />baby head gardens.  The climbing isn't going to force many hike a bikes but &lt;br /&gt;<br />in places it is extended.  The Scenery is worth mentioning.  The trail system &lt;br /&gt;<br />overlooks the Shenandoah river and the valley.  Very nice.  Camping &lt;br /&gt;<br />available.  State Park Fee is $3 or 4$.  Previous trail description listed just &lt;br /&gt;<br />Bear Bottom Loop.  The size and numerous trails require a more up to date &lt;br /&gt;<br />listing.*From Front Royal VA take Route 340 (Stonewall Jackson Highway) South to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;350 Daughter Of Stars Dr, Bentonville, VA.  It is a State Park.  Entrance is on &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the West side of the road.  It is well marked.  From Luray travel North on &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Route 340.*51
609*Cisneros / Snowslide*San Isabel*Colorado*37.98067*-105.07916*16*"(NB: my odometer was acting funny on this trip, so take my distance measurements as estimates.) You can ride this loop clockwise or counterclockwise; I recommend going counterclockwise to take advantage of the Snowslide Trail downhill.  Starting from the bottom of the Snowslide trail, ride up thru the recreation area to the trailhead for the Cisneros trail, or just ride thru the group campground at the end of the road, which also will get you onto the Cisneros.  Begin climbing.  Iím not big on grunting uphill, and Iím even less thrilled about pushing my bike up a trail.  While it is possible to ride up the Cisneros if you are a man of steel, most people will probably end up pushing.  And pushing.  And pushingÖ  By the time I got to the top of the trail I think I pushed a good three miles or more.  Yuck. There is a steep section in the middle that goes on for a couple miles with lots of altitude gain.  Then, after cresting the ridge there is a very pleasant mile and a half or so of gentle uphill thru a meadow area.  Then you encounter a steeper and more heavily bouldered trail that will often force you off the saddle.  After picking up nearly three thousand vertical feet in about nine miles or so you will come to the Greenhorn Mountain Rd (FR369).  Take a left (south) and go about a mile and a half till you see the sign for the Snowslide Trail.  Go to the left (east) uphill till you finally crest out at the top.  You probably have pedaled close to eleven miles to get to that point.  The views are great.  To the north you have a clear view of Pikeís Peak.  To the northeast you will see the city of Pueblo.  Now comes the payoff.  The downhill portion of Snowslide Trail is rocky, steep, narrow, twisting, root infested, and challenging.  In other words, a *lot* of fun.  It took nearly eleven miles of uphill to get to the top ñ you will get to the bottom in about four miles.  Get it?  Steep.  Not far from the top is a nasty, technical section. The hardcore riders will be grinning; everybody else will be dreading what is to come.  Donít worry, it only lasts a hundred yards or so.  After that the trail is mostly rideable by anyone with good technical skills.  What a blast!  Note that near the bottom the trail forks.  Go left if you parked in the recreation area; go right if you parked on the highway. Picking a rating for this trail was difficult to me.  As I was pushing my way up the Cisneros, the number kept decreasing, but by the time I got to the bottom of the Snowslide Trail my rating jumped back up.  If you donít mind long uphills then you probably will feel it is worth a try.  Oh, if you donít want to push your way up the Cisneros, and you have a ground crew, you could just have them drive you to the top of Snowslide."*This trail description combines two trails in a loop: the Cisneros and Snowslide trails that start at the Lake Isabel Recreation Area in the Wet Mountains, southwest of Pueblo.  There are lots of places to start.  I recommend parking at the Snowslide trail, which has two endpoints; one just inside the south entrance to the recreation area, and another a bit down highway 165, past the entrance to the recreation area.*26

593*Elizabeth Furnace*Front Royal*Virginia*38.93506*-78.32004*15*This was a tough ride over advanced terrain due to elevation changes, and frequency and types of obstacles.  Terrain is a mix of doubletrack fire roads and singletrack with several, extended rock gardens, rock outcroppings, technical climbs and descents, and the distance will probably vary considerably depending on how you build your loop.  It is in the Appalachian foothills (Shenandoah Range), so expect some serious climbing (well, at least for us East Coasters).  The saving grace is that a good portion of this was on the initial fireroad section, so establishing something of a cadence was not impossible (loose gravel and sand in the climbs is not conducive to great speed, necessarily).  I would suggest getting a trail map; the blue trail is extremely advanced, very rocky, and would most likely require even the more advanced intermediate riders to dismount and walk portions (admittedly, it was tough just hiking it with the rocks, and in bike cleats).  There are 4-5 creek crossings that were encountered, 3 of which were significant due to depth and large, slick rock.  It was a fantastic ride, and took us about 4.5-5 hours to complete.   Bring plenty of fluids, food (nothing around for miles), first aid kit, and full suspension (you could do this on a hardtail, but rear travel made this a lot more enjoyable I think).   I will definitely do this ride again, and possibly take part in the Shenandoah Mtn 100 race next year (I'd do it this year, but considering the shape I'm in, it would probably kill me).*Trails Located in George Washington National Forest, approx 30 minutes north of Lurray Caverns off of Rt 340/522S from I-66W.  From exit 6 off of Route 66W, proceed south and turn right at about 1.2 miles.  There will be signs to Elizabeth Furnace Day Use area grounds.

619*Rainbow Trail*Westcliffe*Colorado*38.16724*-105.49278*30*This trail is pretty lame.  When I read the description in the MTB Colorado Springs Falcon Guide I was stoked for the 30  miles of singletrack and one of the best rides in Colorado.  After driving about 2 hours from Colorado Springs, we finally made it to the trail.  First of all, the trail can hardly be called singletrack.  If anything, it is a very wide singletrack, wide enough to accommodate a wide ATV.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the large amount of rocks covering most of the trail.  These rocks ranged from fist to head size and they were littered all over the trail.  It is almost impossible to get any kind of rhythm going when trying to ride on flat to slightly upward sloping trail.  I took a bunch of pictures (see sample below) to show you what I mean.  There were a few short stretches of trail that were sweet - smooth trail, lots of trees, etc.  For the most part, however, the trail stunk.*From Westcliffe, take CO Hwy 69 about 11 miles.

530*Brooks Camp Campground*King Salmon*Alaska*58.559722*-155.778056*3*The Brooks Camp Campground in Katmai National Park provides a quintessential Alaskan wildlife experience. When campers step off their floatplane or boat, they enter one of the largest concentrated habitats of brown bears on earth. July and September are the prime bear viewing months and close encounters are common.     Katmai National Monument was established in 1918 to preserve the famed Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a spectacular 40 square miles of deep ash flow deposited by the 1912 volcanic eruption of Novarupta.    A National Park and Preserve since 1980, Katmai is still famous for volcanoes, brown bears, pristine waterways, abundant fish and rugged coastline.*Katmai is 290 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska. There are daily commercial flights from Anchorage to King Salmon. Commercial air taxis fly daily, weather permitting, from King Salmon, Anchorage and Homer to Brooks Camp. Many individual lodges have their own transportation.*34

You'll have excellent views of Wheeler Peak, but the main feature is hiking to the Bristlecone Pine Grove. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Bristlecone Pine Trees are the oldest living (and dead) things on earth. Some are known to have been on this planet for 6,000 years! Once you get to the grove there will be interpretive signs revealing all kinds of information about the ancient trees. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />On the way back you can head straight back to the parking lot, or take a detour onto the Alpine Lakes Loop Trail.*From inside Great Basin National Park, this trail begins at the Bristlecone Parking Area, near the Wheeler Peak Campground.*25
550*Dry Fork Trail*Durango*Colorado*37.33109*-107.93862*9*We went down to Durango for the day and it just so happened that the Iron Horse Classic was in <br />town.  We watched a couple of criterium races then headed for the nearest singletrack just <br />outside town at Dry Fork.  There were a couple of horse trailers in the trailhead parking lot, never <br />a good sign for bikers.  Fortunately, one group of horseback riders was coming off the trail as we <br />geared up and we never saw the other group.  The signs at the trailhead warn riders to avoid the <br />trail when things are wet but we quickly realized by looking at the trail conditions that this <br />warning is rarely heeded.  The tread is hard and bumpy with hoof prints and solidified tire tracks, <br />relics of muddier times.  The climb wasn't too difficult, though we probably went around the loop <br />in the wrong direction based on the number of riders we saw coming the other way (in our <br />defense we decided on the counter-clockwise route after viewing the trailhead map and elevation <br />profile which seemed to indicate that this was the way to go).  The scenery was great, lots of wild <br />flowers and a few nice aspen groves near the top.  The return down was great, a little bumpy <br />with rocks and roots at times.  Check it out if you're in the area, the singletrack doesn't <br />disappoint.*From Durango, take US 160 West about 3 miles and turn right onto Lightner Creek Road (County &lt;br /&gt;Road 207).  Go about a mile and turn right onto Dry Fork Road (County Road 208).  After about 2 &lt;br /&gt;miles, go right at the Y intersection, park at the trailhead on the left after about a mile.  Ride up &lt;br /&gt;the trail and take the left turn at the first intersection onto Dry Fork trail.  When you hit the &lt;br /&gt;Colorado Trail, take a right, then a right onto Hoffheins to complete the loop.  You'll climb about &lt;br /&gt;1200 feet over the 4 or 5 miles to the top.*41
